    <h1>Should Schools Serve Chocolate Milk?</h1>
    <h3>Well there are many cases for this. I will show you an essay that includes reasons on should you buy chocolate milk. </h3>
    <h4>Dear Readers,
     <br>
        Have you heard that people are having a debate over chocolate milk? Some people are saying chocolate milk is good for us, however some disagree.
    I think chocolate milk should not be offered at school, nevertheless we can after all drink chocolate milk at home. Three reasons why I think chocolate milk is bad for us is It has a lot of sugar, can be the cause for diseases, and causes suffering.
            One reason I think chocolate milk should not be served at school is that chocolate milk(flavored milk) can have 30 grams of sugar. This much sugar has no nutritional value at all. According to google,”the effects of added sugar intake - higher blood pressure, inflammation, weight gain, diabetes,and fatty liver disease are all linked to an increased risk for heart attack and stroke.”
            In a video, it was proven that chocolate milk can be the cause for heart disease, prostate cancer, and type 2 diabetes.  These diseases are deathly. They damage body parts and make them not function properly which is the cause for early death. Also, chocolate milk is high in saturated fat and added sugars, which may negatively impact heart health. For example,”research shows that consuming 17-21% of calories from added sugar may increase your risk of heart disease by 38%, compared to consuming less than 8% of calories from added sugar.”
        Lastly, chocolate milk causes suffering. How? Well, cows are impregnated over and over, separated from their young shortly after birth, and slaughtered once their tortured bodies are not productive anymore. More than 1,000 cows are tortured because of this yearly.
        After all you might think that you should not offer milk at all,  please don’t do that for milk has its benefitions too. Milk has calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, and protein. Which if we don’t have, we would be weak and struggle with health issues.
        If you still want to offer chocolate milk, offer it once a week, probably on Friday for a Friyay. This is why I think that chocolate milk is not the best option of beverage for People. Think about it, do you really want your students to have unhealthy eating habits and turn into an unhealthy adult?							
                                    Truthfully,
                                        Your informater.
